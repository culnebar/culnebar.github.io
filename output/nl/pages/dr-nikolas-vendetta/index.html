<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­­ger of the new Im­pe­ri­al Res­­tau­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­ban­k­­ment went
in­­to his luxu­rious pri­­va­­te of­­fi­­ce and shut the door. Ha­­ving do­­ne so, he
­­first scra­t­ched his chin re­flec­­ti­­ve­­ly, and then took a let­­ter from the
­­dra­wer in which it had re­po­­sed for mo­­re than two months and pe­rus­ed it
­­ca­re­­ful­­ly. Though he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thir­­tieth ti­­me he
had read it sin­­ce break­­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
­­ne­a­rer un­­der­stan­­ding it than he had been at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
over and scru­­ti­­ni­­zed the back, whe­­re not a sign of wri­­ting was to be
seen; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might ho­pe to dis­­co­­ver
so­­me­thing from the wa­­ter-­­mark; but the­­re was no­thing in ei­­ther of the­­se
pla­­ces of a na­tu­­re cal­­cu­la­­ted to set his trou­­b­led mind at rest. Then he
took a mag­­ni­­fi­­cent re­pe­a­­ter watch from his wai­st­­coat poc­­ket and glan­­ce­d
at the dial; the hands stood at half­­-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­di­a­­te­­ly thre­w
the let­­ter on the ta­­ble, and as he did so his anx­i­e­ty found re­­lief in­­ words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­al­­ly the most ex­tra­or­­di­­na­ry af­­­fair I ever had to do wit­h,” he
re­­mar­­ked. “And as I’­­ve been in the bu­­si­­ness just three-and-thirty ye­ars
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mon­­day mor­­ning, I ought to know so­­me­thing about it.
I on­­ly ho­pe I’­­ve do­­ne right, tha­t’s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­kee­per, who had the tre­ble ad­van­ta­ge of being
tal­l, pret­ty, and just eight-and-t­wen­ty ye­ars of age, en­te­red the room.
S­he no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chief­’s fa­ce, and her
­cu­ri­o­si­ty was pro­por­ti­o­na­te­ly ex­ci­ted.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You seem wor­rie­d, Mr. Mc­P­her­son,” she said ten­­der­­ly, as she put down
the pa­­pers she had brought in for his ­­sig­­na­tu­­re.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­ve just hit it, Miss O’­­Sul­­li­­van,” he ans­we­re­d, pus­hing them
­­far­­ther on to the ta­­ble. “I am wor­ried about ma­­ny things, but
­par­­ti­­cu­lar­­ly about this let­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He hand­ed the epist­le to her, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
with her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ties, read it with os­ten­ta­tious ca­re. But it
was no­ti­ce­a­ble that when she re­a­ched the sig­na­tu­re she too tur­ned back
­to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over again. The ma­na­ger
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­ving
re­lie­ved his fee­lings in this way, he sea­ted himself again at his
wri­ting-­ta­ble, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­n­i­on, whi­le
wai­ting for her to ­speak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s very fun­­ny,” she said. “Ve­ry fun­­ny in­­dee­d!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most ex­tra­or­­di­­na­ry com­­mu­­ni­­ca­­ti­on I ha­­ve ever re­­cei­­ve­d,” he
re­plied with con­­vic­­ti­on. “You see it is writ­­ten from Cu­y­a­­ba, Bra­­zil. The
­­da­­te is three months ago to a day. Now I ha­­ve ta­­ken the trou­­ble to find
out whe­­re and what Cu­y­a­­ba is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­si­on with an air of con­scious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
so, laid himself back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his wai­st­coa­t, and loo­ked at his fair sub­or­di­na­te for ap­pro­val. Nor
was he des­ti­ned to be dis­ap­poin­ted. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­si­on of a
snug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des being pret­ty, was a la­dy with a keen ey­e
­to the main chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cu­y­a­ba?” she as­ke­d hum­bly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cu­y­a­­ba,” he re­plie­d, rol­­ling his ton­­gue with con­­si­­de­ra­­ble re­­lish round
his un­­con­s­cious mi­spro­nun­­ci­a­­ti­on of the na­­me, “is a to­wn al­­most on the
wes­­­tern or Bo­­li­­vi­an bor­­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­ra­­te si­­ze, is
­­si­tu­a­­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cu­y­a­­ba, and is con­­si­­de­ra­­bly con­­nec­­te­d
with the fa­­mous Bra­­zi­­li­an Dia­­mond ­­Fields.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And does the wri­­ter of this let­­ter li­­ve t­he­re?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I can­­not say. He wri­­tes from the­re—t­hat is en­ough for us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders din­­ner for four—he­re, in a pri­­va­­te room over­loo­­king the
ri­­ver, three months ahe­ad—­­punc­tu­al­­ly at eight o’­­clock, gi­­ves you a lis­t
of the things he wants, and even ar­ran­­ges the de­­co­ra­­ti­on of the ta­­ble.
Says he has ne­­ver seen ei­­ther of his three friends be­­fo­re; that one of
them hails from (he­­re she con­­sul­­ted the let­­ter again) Hang-chow, ano­­ther
from Bloem­­fon­­tein, whi­le the third re­­si­­des, at pre­­sent, in En­g­­land. Each
o­­ne is to pre­­sent an or­­di­­na­ry vi­­si­­ting card with a red dot on it to the
por­­ter in the hal­l, and to be shown to the room at on­­ce. I don’t
un­­der­­stand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­ment, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly,—”Hang-chow
is in Chi­na, Bloem­fon­tein is in Sou­t­h Af­ri­ca.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a won­­der­­ful man you are, to be su­re, Mr. Mc­P­her­son! I ne­­ver can
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so much in your head.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rec­ti­on,
­for the ma­na­ger was sus­cep­ti­ble to her gent­le in­flu­en­ce, as she had
oc­ca­si­on to ­know.</p> 
 <p>At this junc­tu­re the head wai­ter ap­pe­a­red upon the sce­ne, and took up a
­po­si­ti­on just in­si­de the door­way, as if he we­re af­raid of in­ju­ring the
­car­pet by co­ming ­far­ther.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 rea­­dy, ­­Wil­­li­ams?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­­te rea­­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and cook tells me he’ll be
rea­­dy to dish punc­tu­al to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The let­­ter says, ‘no elec­tric light; cand­les with red sha­­des.’ Ha­­ve you
­­put on tho­­se sha­­des I got this ­­mor­­ning?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just seen it do­­ne this very mi­nu­­te, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me see, the­­re was one other thing.” He took the let­­ter from the
chief book­­kee­per’s hand and glan­­ced at it. “Ah, yes, a por­­ce­lain sau­­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­­tel­pie­­ce. An ex­tra­or­­di­­na­ry
re­­quest, but has it been at­­ten­­de­d to?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­self, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who wait?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­nes, Ed­­munds, Brook­s, an­d Tom­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Very good. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­­ter tell the
hall por­­ter to look out for three gent­le­­men pre­­sen­­ting plain vi­­si­­ting
­­cards with a lit­t­le red spot on them. Let Brooks wait in the hal­l, an­d
w­hen they ar­ri­­ve tell him to show them straight up to the room.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p>The head wai­ter left the room, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched himself in his
chair, yaw­ned by way of showing his im­por­tan­ce, and then said so­lemn­ly,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t be­­lie­­ve they’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­­Ni­­ko­la, whoe­­ver he may be, won’t be ab­le to find fault with my ar­ran­­ge­­ments.”</p> 
 <p>Then, lea­ving the dusty high road of Bu­si­nes­s, he and his com­pa­n­i­on
wan­de­red in the sha­dy brid­le-­pa­ths of Lo­ve—­to the end that when the
chief book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
­stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to ta­ke pla­ce up­stairs, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­ti­on as to how she would look in whi­te sa­tin an­d
o­ran­ge blos­soms, an­d, that sett­le­d, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
tru­e, as Miss Joy­ce, a sub­or­di­na­te, had been heard to de­cla­re, that the
­ma­na­ger had on­ce shown himself par­ti­al to a cer­tain wi­dow with re­pu­te­d
sa­vings and a sha­re in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dairy ­bu­si­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
ho­tel. As soon as it stop­pe­d, an un­der­si­zed gent­le­man, with a cle­an
s­ha­ven coun­tenan­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­ti­on, and bow leg­s, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal gar­b, aligh­ted. He paid and di­schar­ged his ca­b­man,
and then took from his tic­ket poc­ket an or­di­na­ry whi­te vi­si­ting car­d,
w­hich he pre­sen­ted to the gold-la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
apron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­t­ed the red spot, cal­l­ed a wai­ter, and the
re­ve­rend gent­le­man was im­me­di­a­te­ly es­cor­te­d up­stairs.</p> 
 <p>Hard­ly had the at­ten­dant ti­me to re­turn to his sta­ti­on in the hal­l,
­be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pe­a­ran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tal­l, ac­ti­ve, wel­l-­built man of about thirty­
ye­ars of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fas­hi­on, an­d
­to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of hea­vy­
tex­tu­re. He al­so in his turn hand­ed a whi­te card to the por­ter, an­d,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hal­l, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
last ca­b, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his example. This in­di­vi­du­al was also
in eve­ning dres­s, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was old-­fas­hi­o­ne­d
and had seen much use. The wea­rer, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry run
of men, whi­le it was no­ti­ce­a­ble that his hair was snow-w­hi­te, and tha­t
his fa­ce was dee­ply pit­ted with small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hat­s
and coats in an an­te-room, they re­a­ched room No. 22, whe­re they found
the gent­le­man in cle­ri­cal cos­tu­me pa­cing im­pa­tient­ly up an­d ­down.</p> 
 <p>Left alone, the tal­lest of the tri­o, who for want of a bet­ter tit­le we
­may call the Best Dres­sed Man, took out his watch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, loo­ked at his com­pa­n­i­ons. “Gent­le­men,” he said, with a slight
A­me­ri­can ac­cent, “it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o’­clock. My na­me is E­asto­ver!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to hear it, for I’m most un­­com­­mon­­ly hun­­gry,” said the nex­t
tal­les­t, whom I ha­­ve al­rea­­dy de­s­cri­­bed as being so mar­­ked by di­­sea­­se.
“­­My na­­me is Pren­­der­­gast!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­­ly wait for our friend and hos­t,” re­­mar­­ked the cle­ri­­cal gent­le­­man,
as if he felt he ought to ta­­ke a sha­­re in the con­­ver­sa­­ti­on, and then, as
an af­­­terthought, he con­­ti­­nue­d, “My na­­me is ­­Bax­­ter!”</p> 
 <p>They shook hands all round with mar­ked cor­di­a­li­ty, sea­ted them­sel­ves­
a­gain, and took it in turns to exa­mi­ne the ­clock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you ever had the plea­­su­­re of mee­­ting our host be­­fo­re?” as­­ked Mr.
­­Bax­­ter of Mr. Pren­­der­­gast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ver,” re­plied that gent­le­­man, with a sha­­ke of his head. “Per­haps Mr.
E­asto­­ver has been mo­re ­­for­tu­­na­­te?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the brief rejoin­­der. “I’­­ve had to do with him off and on
­­for lon­­ger than I ca­­re to reck­on, but I’­­ve ne­­ver set ey­es on him up to ­­da­­te.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­­ve been the first ti­­me you heard from him?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Na­s­h­­vil­le, Ten­­nes­­see,” said Easto­­ver. “Af­­ter tha­t, Ta­hu­pa­pa, Ne­w
­­Ze­a­­land; af­­­ter tha­t, Pa­pee­­te, in the So­­ci­e­­ty Is­­lands; then Pe­­kin, Chi­­na.
And y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Brus­­sels; se­­cond, Mon­­te Vi­­deo; third, Man­­da­lay, and then
the Gold Coast, Af­­ri­­ca. It’s your tur­n, Mr. ­­Bax­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was exact­ly eight o’­clock.
“­First ti­me, Ca­bul, Af­gha­nis­tan; se­cond, Nij­ni No­vgorod, Rus­si­a; third,
­Wil­can­ni­a, Dar­ling Ri­ver, Au­stra­li­a; fourth, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fift­h,
­Na­gas­a­ki, Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­dent­­ly a gre­at tra­­vel­ler and a most mys­­­te­rious ­per­­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than tha­t,” said Easto­­ver with con­­vic­­ti­on; “he is la­­te for ­­din­­ner!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­gast loo­ked at his watch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­nu­­tes fast. Hark, the­­re goes Big Ben! Eight exac­t­­ly.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the door was thrown open and a voi­ce an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Ni­ko­la.”</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­neous­ly, with ex­cla­ma­ti­ons of
as­to­nish­ment, as the man they had been dis­cus­sing ma­de his ap­pe­a­ran­ce.</p> 
 <p>It would ta­ke mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
a­de­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve de­scrip­ti­on of the per­son who en­te­red the room at
t­hat mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was slightly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, his
s­houl­ders we­re broad, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and plain­ly mus­cu­lar,
­but very slim. His he­ad, which was mag­ni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­ders,
was ador­ned with a pro­fu­si­on of glos­sy black hair; his fa­ce was
­des­ti­tu­te of be­ard or mousta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and handsome
­moul­ding; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hue, a co­lour which
har­mo­ni­zed well with his pier­cing black ey­es and pe­ar­ly teet­h. His hands
and feet we­re smal­l, and the gre­a­test dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
was ir­re­pro­a­cha­bly dres­se­d, with a neat­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he might ha­ve been any­thing from eight-and-t­wen­ty to
­for­ty; in re­a­li­ty he was thirty­-­three. He ad­van­ced in­to the room an­d
wal­ked with out-­stret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to whe­re Easto­ver was
­stan­ding by the ­fire­pla­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Easto­­ver, I feel cer­tain,” he said, fixing his glit­­te­ring ey­es upon
the man he ad­dres­­se­d, and al­lo­wing a cu­rious smi­le to play upon his ­­fa­­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Ni­­ko­la,” the other ans­we­red with evi­­dent sur­pri­­se.
“­­But how on earth can you dis­­tin­­guish me from your other ­­gue­st­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would sur­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pren­­der­­gast, and Mr.
­­Bax­­ter. This is de­­lightful; I ho­pe I am not la­­te. We had a col­­li­­si­on in­­
the Chan­­nel this mor­­ning, and I was al­­most af­­raid I might not be up to
­­ti­­me. Din­­ner see­­ms rea­­dy; shall we sit down to it?” They sea­­te­d
them­­sel­­ves, and the me­al com­­men­­ced. The Im­pe­ri­al Res­­tau­rant has ear­­ne­d
an en­­vi­a­­ble re­­pu­ta­­ti­on for do­ing things wel­­l, and the din­­ner that night
­­did not in any way de­tract from its lus­­tre. But, de­­lightful as it al­l
was, it was no­­ti­­ce­a­­ble that the three guests paid mo­­re at­­ten­­ti­on to
t­heir host than to his ex­­cel­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re his
ar­ri­val, they had all had de­a­lings with him for se­ve­r­al ye­ars, but wha­t
tho­se de­a­lings we­re they we­re ca­re­ful not to de­scri­be. It was mo­re than
­pos­si­ble that they hard­ly li­ked to re­mem­ber them them­sel­ves.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had been ser­ved and the ser­vants had wit­h­drawn, Dr. Ni­ko­la
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­board. On it
­stood a bas­ket of very cu­rious sha­pe and work­mans­hip. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the as­to­nish­ment of his guest­s, an enor­mous ca­t, as
­black as his mas­ter’s coa­t, le­a­ped out on to the floor. The rea­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Sea­ting himself at the ta­ble again, the host fol­lo­wed the example of his
­guests and lit a ci­gar, blo­wing a cloud of smo­ke luxu­rious­ly through his
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­s­el­led nos­trils. His ey­es wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
the room, took in the pic­tu­res and de­co­ra­ti­ons, and then ca­me down to
­meet the fa­ces of his com­pa­n­i­ons. As they did so, the black ca­t, ha­ving
­fi­nis­hed its me­al, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, wat­ching
the three men through the cur­ling smo­ke drift with its green blin­king,
­fien­dish ey­es. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
u­pon his ­guests.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­­si­­nes­s?” he said ­­bris­­kly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­neous­ly knock­ed the as­hes off their ci­gars an­d
­brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­ti­on. Dr. Ni­ko­la’s dain­ty, lan­guid man­ner
­see­med to drop from him li­ke a clo­ak, his ey­es brigh­te­n­ed, and his
­voi­ce, when he spo­ke, was clean cut as chi­s­el­le­d ­sil­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are doubt­less anx­i­ous to be in­­­for­­med why I sum­­mo­­ned you from al­l
parts of the glo­­be to meet me he­­re to-­­night? And it is very na­tu­ral you
s­hould be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
­­sur­pri­­sed at any­thing I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p>His voi­ce drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gent­le lan­gu­or. He drew in a
­gre­at bre­ath of smo­ke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips again.
His ey­es we­re half clo­se­d, and he drum­med with one fin­ger on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat loo­ked through the smo­ke at the three men, and it see­me­d
­to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fero­cious. Pre­sent­ly
his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and sea­ting him on his knee fell to
­stro­king his fur, from head to tail, with his long slim fin­gers. It was
as if he we­re dra­wing in­spi­ra­ti­on for so­me dead­ly mischief from the
uncan­ny ­be­ast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­fa­­ce what I ha­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by­­
­­far the most im­por­tant bu­­si­­ness for which I ha­­ve ever re­­qui­red your
help. (Three slow stro­­kes down the cen­­tre of the back, and one round
each ear.) When it first ca­­me in­­­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the ma­t­­ter. I thought of Vendon, but I found Ven­­don was dead. I
t­hought of Brown­low, but Brown­low was no lon­­ger faith­­ful. (T­wo stro­­kes
­­down the back and two on the thro­at.) Then bit by bit I re­­mem­­be­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so ­­good.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fire­pla­ce. As he went the cat craw­le­d
­back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­ti­on on his shoul­der. Then his voi­ce chan­ge­d
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer bu­si­nes­s-­li­ke ­to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not go­ing to tell you very much about it. But from what I do tel­l
y­ou, you will be ab­le to ga­­ther a gre­at deal and ima­­gi­­ne the rest. To
­­be­­gin wit­h, the­­re is a man li­­ving in this world to-­­day who has do­­ne me a
­­gre­at and las­­ting in­­­ju­ry. What that in­­­ju­ry is is no con­­cern of yours.
You would not un­­der­­stand if I told you. So we’ll lea­­ve that out of the
­­ques­­ti­on. He is im­­men­­se­­ly rich. His che­­que for £300,000 would be
ho­nou­red by his bank at any mi­nu­­te. Ob­­vious­­ly he is a po­wer. He has had
rea­­son to know that I am pit­­ting my wits against his, and he fla­t­­ters
himself that so far he has got the bet­­ter of me. That is be­­cau­­­se I am
­­dra­wing him on. I am ma­tu­ring a plan which will ma­­ke him a poor and a
­­ve­ry mi­­se­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me suc­­ceed­s,
and I am sa­­tis­­fied with the way you three men ha­­ve per­­for­­med the parts I
s­hall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it doe­sn’t suc­­ceed, then you will each re­­cei­­ve a thou­sand
and your ex­pen­­ses. Do you fol­low ­­me?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from their fa­ces that they hung upon his eve­ry word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>But, re­­mem­­ber, I de­­mand from you your who­le and en­­ti­­re la­­bour. Whi­le
you are ser­­ving me you are mi­­ne bo­­dy and soul. I know you are
trust­wort­hy. I ha­­ve had good proof that you are—par­­don the
­ex­­pres­­si­on—uns­­cru­­pu­lou­s, and I fla­t­­ter my­self you are si­lent. What is
­­mo­re, I shall tell you no­thing be­y­ond what is ne­­ces­sa­ry for the car­rying
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
­­my plans!”</p> 
 <p>He sat down again and took a pa­per from his poc­ket. Ha­ving pe­rus­ed it,
he tur­ned to E­asto­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will lea­­ve at on­­ce—t­hat is to say, by the boat on We­d­­nes­­day—­­for
Sy­d­­ney. You will book your pas­­sa­­ge to-­­mor­row mor­­ning, first thing, an­d
join her in Ply­­mouth. You will meet me to-­­mor­row eve­­ning at an ad­dress I
­­will send you, and re­­cei­­ve your fi­­nal in­­­struc­­ti­ons­. ­­Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>See­ing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Easto­ver ro­se, shook hands, and left
the room wit­hout a word. He was too as­to­nis­hed to he­si­ta­te or to say a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la took ano­ther let­ter from his poc­ket and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to-­night, cross to Pa­ris to-­mor­row mor­ning,
and lea­ve this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at half­-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
ans­wer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in­
t­hat en­ve­lo­pe to pay all your ex­pen­ses. Now ­go!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At half­­-­­past two you shall ha­­ve your ans­wer. ­­Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the room, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit ano­ther ci­gar an­d
tur­ned his at­ten­ti­ons to Mr. ­Bax­ter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six months ago, Mr. Bax­­ter, I found for you a si­tu­a­­ti­on as tu­­tor to the
y­oung Mar­­quis of Bec­­ken­ham. You still hold it, I ­­sup­po­­se?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fa­­ther well dis­po­­sed to­­wards y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­ry way. I ha­­ve do­­ne my best to in­­­gra­­ti­a­­te my­self with him. Tha­t
was one of your in­­struc­­ti­ons­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Yes, yes! But I was not cer­tain that you would suc­­ceed. If the old man
is any­thing li­­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
­­dif­­fi­­cult per­­son to deal with. Does the boy li­­ke y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­pe ­­so.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you brought me his pho­to­­graph as I ­­di­rec­­te­d?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­ve. He­­re it is.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­graph from his poc­ket and hand­ed it across the ­ta­ble.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Good. You ha­­ve do­­ne very wel­­l, Mr. Bax­­ter. I am plea­­sed with you.
To-­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to Y­ork­s­hi­re——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your par­­don, Bour­­ne­­mouth. His Gra­­ce owns a hou­­se ne­ar
­­Bour­­ne­­mout­h, which he oc­­cu­pies du­ring the sum­­mer ­m­­onths.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Very wel­­l—­­then to-­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to Bour­­ne­­mouth an­d
­­con­­ti­­nue to in­­­gra­­ti­a­­te yourself with fa­­ther and son. You will al­­so be­­gin
­­to im­plant in the boy’s mind a desi­­re for tra­­vel. Don’t let him be­­co­­me
a­wa­­re that his desi­­re has its sour­­ce in you—­­but do not fail to fos­­ter
it all you can. I will com­­mu­­ni­­ca­­te with you fur­­ther in a day or two. Now ­­go.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the room. The door clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pick­ed up
the pho­to­graph and stu­die­d it.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­­ke­­ness is un­­mis­ta­­ka­­ble—or it ought to be. My friend, my ver­­y
­­dear friend, Wet­he­rel­l, my toils are clo­­sing on you. My ar­ran­­ge­­ments are
per­­fec­­ting them­­sel­­ves ad­­mi­ra­­bly. Pre­­sent­­ly, when all is com­ple­­te, I
s­hall press the le­­ver, the ma­chi­­ne­ry will be set in mo­­ti­on, and you wil­l
find yourself being slow­­ly but su­re­­ly ground in­­­to pow­­der. Then you wil­l
hand over what I want, and be sor­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr. ­­Ni­­ko­la!”</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty di­schar­ge­d, he pla­ce­d
the cat back in its prison, shut the lid, des­cen­ded with the bas­ket to
the hal­l, and cal­l­ed a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
s­hould or­der the ca­b­man to dri­ve. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­ply for a mo­ment,
­then he said, as if he had been thin­king so­me­thing out: “The  <em>Green
­Sai­lor</em>  pu­blic-hou­se, East In­dia Dock Road.”</p>
